What you want to look at is the procedure iFindPeriod2() in the file
fperiod.c. This procedure does true fractional arithmetic. Therefore
it is a bit convoluted. The procedure FindPeriod2() in the same file
does floating point computations and converts the floats to fractions.
Of course, this is prone to round-off errors and iFindPeriod2() should
be preferred, but FindPeriod2() is probably easier to understand.

The idea behind FindPeriod2() is fairly simple and after looking at the
old source code again I am not sure if the source code is actually helpful.
An important trick is to start searching for periods from the end, because
some of the first terms can be special.
